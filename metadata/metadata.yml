name: 'FRA: Face Representation Augmentation'
description: Since data scarcity is a common problem in deep learning-based solutions,
  it can be very challenging to build up FR systems that are robust enough to recognize
  face images with extreme diversity. In this project, we experiment our method that
  augments the face data in latent space. The proposed method utilizes two major components,
  one of which is an autoencoder, and the other is a ViT-based model. The former encodes
  the binarized input images consisting of sparse facial landmarks into a latent space.
  The latter is used for extracting features from the combined embeddings from a pre-trained
  FRL approach and the autoencoder part of our model. Lastly, the output of the proposed
  model is an embedding representing the main identity with the same emotion but with
  a different posture.
